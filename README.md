This is a repository to analyze my finances.

## Installation

use [Lookerstudio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/) to do analasis of your finished, cleaned data.

## Background
I needed a way to track fully customize and view my finances.

The other apps and websites I used did not provide me the freedom and ability that I was able to make for myself.
 

## Categorizations
I created categories for example **Rent**, **Groceries**, **Car** etc... for all my spending habits in order to see the breakdown month by month of where my money was going.

Filters for each category are there if one would want to see spednign on various **categories** or even specific **Date** ranges.

I created three different dahsboards
* one for my Credits(incoming money)
* one for my Debits(money spent)
* one for my net(Credits-Debits)
  
## Dashboard

There are categorization filters if you need to see something more specific in your finances.

The **Line Graph** displays money changes over time .

The **Bar Graph** has all the value of each individual *Category* in asceding order (Left=Lowest) (Right=Highest)

The bottom chart is all the information at once to have an overall view in one place.
